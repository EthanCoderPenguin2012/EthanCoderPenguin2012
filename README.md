Hi! My name is Ethan, a teen developer from the UK. Since getting a Raspberry Pi for my 7th birthday, I have always wanted to make things for people. 
From web apps, to silly python scripts, I really make what ever comes to mind. Take a look at my stats and stack below:

## What else I do
I don't just code here! I am a solo developer at [Neo Studios](https://github.com/Neo-Studios), and have assisted with many projects over at [BuildOne](https://github.com/BuildOneRobotics).
